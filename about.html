                    <h2>About Our Guest Rooms</h2>
                    <p class="abp">Guest experience is about ensuring hotel guests feel welcomed, satisfied, enriched, and that they got value for their money.
                         It’s important that the guest experience feels authentic and unique to every individual, so that it creates a lasting memory 
                         for the customer. Guest experience in hotels include the entire customer journey, from researching and booking all the way through to post-stay.

                        When it comes to pleasing guests, ‘personalisation’ is as buzzed as a word can get, but for good reason; there’s no excuse not to be taking a more focused approach to customer interaction. However, optimising the guest experience and ensuring guest expectations are met is a constantly evolving challenge for hoteliers.With a veritable banquet of options at their fingertips, travellers are demanding more than ever before. It makes life harder for hotels, but also gives them a greater opportunity to deliver an experience guests will never forget. 
                        The collection and use of customer data will allow a hotel to effectively personalise their service for guests.</p>
